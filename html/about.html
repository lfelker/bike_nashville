        I am broadly interested in maps, data visualization, software development, accessibility, social justice, and ecology. I recently received my Bachelor's from the University of Washington Computer Science program. My experience during that time includes studying the ecological impacts of climate change as a field crew leader and researcher in the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jhrl/Index.html">HRL Lab</a> and working as a software developer for <a href="https://www.accessmapseattle.com/">Access Map Seattle</a> where I developed an interactive map for Android devices to help people with limited mobility navigate Seattle.
      </p>

        After graduating I traveled for a year, bicycling throughout SouthEast Asia and thru-hiking the entire Appalachian Trail, and have recently settled back in Seattle, WA to pursue a career in software development and map making.
