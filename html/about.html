        I am an aspiring geospatial wizard. I am broadly interested in maps, data visualization, software development, accessibility, social justice, and ecology. I recently received my bachelors from the University of Washington Computer Science program. My experience during that time includes: studying the ecological impacts of climate change as a field crew leader and researcher in the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jhrl/Index.html">HRL Lab</a> and working as a software developer for <a href="https://www.accessmapseattle.com/">Access Map Seattle</a> where I developed an interactive map on Android to help people with limited mobility navigate Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating I traveled for a year - to South East Asia and along the Appalachian Trail - and have recently settled back to Seattle, WA to pursue a career in software development and mapmaking.

        In my free time you can find me thru-hiking long trails or bike touring in remote locations.
