<h3>Nashville Interactive Bike Map</h3>
<p>
  Bike Nashville is an ongoing project that aims to simplify the experience of choosing a safe and effective bike route in Nashville, TN. The map currently distributed by the city of Nashville is out of date, has incomplete routes, is visually hard to understand, and is primarily designed for tourists. This project involved compiling data - from Open Street Map, the city's Planning Department, and locals' knowlege of good routes - to build shapefiles in QGIS that are comprehensive and up to date. I initially designed the graphics of the map in QGIS and later translated them to MapBox. You can see the current interactive beta version below.
