<h3>Nashville Interactive Bike Map</h3>
<p>
  Bike Nashville is an ongoing project with the goal of simplifying the experience of choosing a safe and effective bike route when communting in Nashville, TN. The current map that the city of city distributes is out of date, has incomplete routes, is visually hard to understand, and is primarily designed for tourists. Additionally using mapping applications doesn't give you a good understanding of the safety and infrastructure on the route. The project involved compiling data from open street map, the city planning department, and local's knowlege of good routes to build shapefiles in QGIS that are comprehensive and up to date. Additionally designing the graphics of the map originally with QGIS and later with MapBox. You can see the current interactive beta version below.
